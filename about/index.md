Hi there. I'm Luke Merrick, a Data Scientist who has recently joined [Fiddler.ai][fiddler]. Before joining Fiddler, I spent most of 2018 working as the Head Data Scientist at [Soteris, Inc.][soteris], where I worked to bring cutting-edge machine learning technology to the insurance industry. Previously, I founded and built the now-dormant [Infimum Technologies][infimum] while studying at the University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science.

I have been a machine learning enthusiast for a number of years, working on projects both inside and outside of the classroom in a wide array of applications, from activity-tracking to marketing to even selfie classification (you can see a few examples on my [projects][projects] page). On the academic side, I spent my undergraduate capstone research experience exploring the fundamental research question of *how and why* deep learning works, which I consider to be one of the most fascinating questions in all of ML. I authored the paper "Exploring the use of adaptive gradient methods in effective deep learning systems" (DOI: [10.1109/SIEDS.2018.8374740][adaptive_doi]) to present the results of this research.

I have a passion for leveraging quantitative analysis and creative thinking in equal measure. While my technical skills lend themselves to diving deep into modeling and code, my passion for an engaged exchange of ideas leads me to seek a vocal and active role in whichever teams I work with. I am a big fan of Design Thinking, Systems Thinking, and solving real and human problems with the incredibly powerful tools being developed at the cutting-edge of research.
