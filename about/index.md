Hi there. I'm Luke Merrick, the Head Data Scientist at [Soteris, Inc.][soteris] and founder of [Infimum Technologies, LLC][infimum]. I'm graduating from the University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science in May 2018, and I'm excited to transition full-time into my work with Soteris.

I have been a machine learning nerd for a number of years, working on projects both inside and outside of the classroom in a wide array of applications, from activity-tracking to marketing to even selfie classification (you can see a few examples on my [projects][projects] page). On the academic side, as part of my undergraduate capstone research I'm currently exploring the research questions of *how and why* deep learning works, which I find is one of the most fascinating topics in the entire field of machine learning.

I have a passion for leveraging quantitative analysis and creative thinking in equal measure. While my technical skills lend themselves to diving deep into modeling and code, my passion for an engaged exchange of ideas leads me to seek a vocal and active role in whichever teams I work with. I am a big fan of Design Thinking, Systems Thinking, and solving real and human problems with the incredibly powerful tools being developed at the cutting-edge of research.
