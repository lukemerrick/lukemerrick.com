Hi there.

## Who am I?
* **University student**: I am currently and undergraduate at the University of Virginia studying in the Systems Engineering and Computer Science departments. In March 2017 I was accepted into the UVA Systems Engineering Masters Early Research Program, and I am currently pursuing a focus in the theory of Machine Learning.
* **Data scientist**: I have a passion for Machine Learning and many of its current and future applications, from engineering smarter business decisions to creating autonomous vehicles. If you want to see some of the data science and Machine Learning work I've done, look no farther than the [projects]({{ site.url }}/projects/) page.

I have a passion for leveraging quantitative analysis and creative thinking in equal measure. While my technical skills lend themselves to diving deep into the modeling and code, my passion for an engaged exchange of ideas leads me to seek a vocal and active role in whichever teams I work with. I am a big fan of Design Thinking, Systems Thinking, and solving real and human problems with the incredibly powerful tools being developed at the cutting-edge of research.
